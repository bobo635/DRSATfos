3. `killall -9 nginx_fos`
4. `/home/fos-streaming/fos/nginx/sbin/nginx_fos`

## How can I use it?
- Default login: admin / admin
  - Add user
  - Add stream and use defined transcode profile 1 called **Default 1**
- You can use it also in proxy mode, but that depends on how you want to use it.
- The most stable way is using transcode profile: **Default 1** without proxy mode ticket
